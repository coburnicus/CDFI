                    <p>Nationwide, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and similar organizations are positively impacting underserved communities’ access to affordable credit and capital. A marginalized subgroup within those communities are often people with disabilities. </p>

                    <p>The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at UMass Boston offers training, clinical and employment services, conducts research, and provides assistance to organizations to promote inclusion of people with disabilities in school, work, and community activities. For over 40 years, ICI has worked to ensure that people with disabilities have the same opportunity to dream big, and make their dreams a fully included, integrated, and welcomed reality. As a leader not only in Massachusetts, but also nationally and internationally, ICI strives to create a world where all people with disabilities are welcome and fully included in valued roles wherever they go, whether a school, workplace, volunteer group, home, or any other part of the community. All of ICI's efforts stem from one core value: that people with disabilities are more of an expert than anyone else. Therefore, people with disabilities should have the same rights and controls and maintain lives based on their individual preferences, choices, and dreams. </p>
